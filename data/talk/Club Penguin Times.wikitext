Hi. I've found some of this archives, but only in portuguese. Is this useful?

== New Format ==

I converted the most of the issues into the new format. Unsure who is editing this I put it on separate page [[User:Lisured/Club_Penguin_Times]]. Can I add it to this page? I also removed Portuguese as the links are omni-lingual. --[[User:Lisured|Lisured]] ([[User talk:Lisured|talk]]) 18:34, 26 October 2014 (UTC)
