== Movie clips ==

Are those Movie clips really necessary? AFAIK this is a SWF archive, where everything should be kept original, and those are gathered from one SWF, so I think that this is kinda stupid, because this is an '''archive''', and an archive's purpose is to keep the original stuff, not some edited crap.  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 21:04, 9 April 2015 (UTC)
