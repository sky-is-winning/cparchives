==October 2011 and after==
Please note that the catalogs since October 2011 are based on a container file, that uses other files under one directory (on this casle, ''/play/v2/client/merch/''). It might be possible to make them visible for the readers by creating a new folder in the CPN archive server, and add those files to it. Those are the files:
*http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/client/merch/treasurebook.swf
*http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/client/merch/views.swf
*http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/client/merch/inGameTreasurebookViewer.swf
I am not sure if they are based on domain detector as well, but i think it worth a try.<br />
