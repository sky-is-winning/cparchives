What's the music for the Snow Forts during the Zootopia Party? Thanks. --[[fanon:User:Mrdave921|'''''Mrdave921''''']] [[fanon:User talk:Mrdave921|This is my talk page.]] 15:35, 12 June 2016 (UTC)

:The Zootopia Party on the new wiki is just two amboxes, and it doesn't say anything about music on the old wiki's Zootopia Party page. --[[fanon:User:Mrdave921|'''''Mrdave921''''']] [[fanon:User talk:Mrdave921|This is my talk page.]] 00:55, 16 June 2016 (UTC)

::Yeah, ever since [[User:Nando144|Nando144]] became inactive on the CPWN, it's been rough there in terms of content. Anyway, I meant that you should check the [[Zootopia Party]] page on ''this'' wiki. You will find the ID and link to the Snow Forts music there. If by chance you also want the name of it, it's [http://media8.clubpenguin.com/mobile/world/parties/en_US/deploy/sound/all_platforms/music/060518_may/MUS_Party_Zootopia_Forts_MysticJungleAmb.mp3 Mystic Jungle ambiance] according to the mobile file. --[[User:Kawkeetcp|Kawkeetcp]] ([[User talk:Kawkeetcp|talk]]) 06:44, 16 June 2016 (UTC)
