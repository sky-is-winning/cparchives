== Not Working ==

This .swf file doesn't work it just displays a white screen.
It won't work, and I don't know why. But if you need it, you can view it [http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/games/waves/bootstrap.swf here]. --'''[[User:PenblooeR|<span style="color:#6CB3E3;">Pen</span>]][[User talk:PenblooeR|<span style="color:#4B81A4">BlooeR</span>]]''' 01:58, 19 June 2012 (UTC)
