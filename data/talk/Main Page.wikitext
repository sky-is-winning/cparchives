File namespace needs to be treated as a content namespace, and you should adjust Apache to open SWF files in-browser. (Or I might have Flash disabled a long time ago and not know it) --'''[[User:Refractor|<span style="background-color:#010199;color:#EEE;padding:1px">refractor</span>]]'''[[User talk:Refractor|<span style="color:#0101AA;background-color:white">&nbsp;this is a thing</span>]]<staff/> 12:03, 13 December 2010 (UTC)

==Wiki statistics==
It's possible to list the number of uploaders by doing something like:
<pre>{{NUMBERINGROUP:Uploader}} users with [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|uploader rights]].</pre>
Which results:<br />
{{NUMBERINGROUP:Uploader}} users with [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|uploader rights]].<br />
[[user:Penguin-Pal|<font color="0e92cf">Penguin-Pal</font>]] [[user talk:Penguin-Pal|<font color="2e47aa">(talk)</font>]] 17:03, 29 December 2012 (UTC)

== request for testing: swf rendering ==

Can people try the [http://www.clubpenguinwiki.info/scripts/swfrender/ new SWF renderer] on the server? It essentially automates what the [[clubpenguinwiki:Project:SWFs Guide|guide]] does, but some people have rendering problems (it seems to vary by server)

Someday, I'll do a MW extension, but this will require regex voodoo --'''[[User:Refractor|<span style="color:#263852;padding:1px">refractor</span>]]''' 01:11, 14 February 2014 (UTC)

== Login screens ==

New login pages use images instead of flash. Should they be archived? --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 00:40, 8 February 2015 (UTC)

I don't see the need as long as the images are uploaded to the [http://www.clubpenguinwiki.info/ main wiki].

::I think they should be, we're archives, we should archive also other stuff than SWFs  {{User:Misabr/sig2}} 10:01, 7 June 2015 (UTC)

== Missions List ==

I can't seem to find a page listing the missions dialog (the machine in EPF and the paper in PSA, [[Media:ArtworkToolsMissions4.swf|Media:Earlyfourpsasecretmissions.swf]] is a good example of what I mean...)  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 19:07, 10 April 2015 (UTC)

== Movie Clips ==

I found out, that on the wiki there are several movie clips, like [[File:ClothingSprites4690MovieClip330.swf]] extracted from the original SWF files... I think those are kinda useless, when we are an archive, so I suggest them being removed (I can do the job, I just need your opinion)  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 20:10, 10 April 2015 (UTC)
BTW there are even pages based on listing movie clips, like [[Yarr]]  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 20:11, 10 April 2015 (UTC)
:The basic thing I meant here: Can I remove the movie clips I found? We're an archive to archive CP's files, not some edited crap!  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 02:19, 12 April 2015 (UTC)

== Archive other stuff than SWFs ==

Hello! I think that we can take archives to a higher level! By that I mean that we could not archive only SWFs, but even login screen images, mobile app game files, JSONs and so on! What do you think?  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 12:32, 23 April 2015 (UTC)

== File moving ==

The recurrent file moving in CP Archives is breaking a lot of links on CP Wiki Português. Does anybody know a solution for this issue? --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 02:34, 1 May 2015 (UTC)
Use interwikis on PT CPWIKI - make the links something like: <nowiki>[[:en:archives:Media:RoomsTown-CaveMaze.swf]]</nowiki> (for example), then redirects would work (if someone doesn't remove them...)  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 08:26, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

== 2015 room parties template ==

Hello. I've come up with an idea (again). The idea is to use a template on all room pages to list the party rooms. Rooms that wouldn't be changed for the party would redirect to their normal version. Here's an example for Town:
{{User:Misabr/sandbox_2/Rooms|Town|[[Media:Music836.swf|836]]|[[Media:Music867.swf|867]]|[[Media:Music896.swf|896]]}}

or for Coffee Shop (we would make the red links redirect to the normal version of the room)

{{User:Misabr/sandbox_2/Rooms|Coffee}}

 {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 14:43, 4 May 2015 (UTC)
*I see no need to list parties if the room wasn't decorated. --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 22:04, 4 May 2015 (UTC) P.S.: We need to create a page for dicussions, because we are misusing the Main Page talk.
**For the list, most of the rooms are missing most of stuff, have a look at [[Cave]], this would make it easier to update - that's why I suggested it. As for the talk page, agreed here, we need something like [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Village_pump|Wikipedia's Village pump]] in one page...  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 22:27, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

== Evil Vision Goggles ==

I've been looking through [[special:UnusedFiles]] and I saw this: [[media:Paper1000102.swf]] [[media:Sprites1000102.swf]] [[media:1000102.swf]]. Here is the problem. What to do with these files? AFAIK we archive regular CP stuff, not custom stuff, but those ones were uploaded by [[user:ClubPenguinMaster]]. So, what to do with these files?  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 13:31, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

== Naming system ==

we REALLY NEED an unified naming system for rooms... Right now, when I create some missing room pages (or update informations), it's hard to find the rooms, because the names don't follow an unified system. I think, that all rooms should be uploaded as "File:RoomsNameOfTheRoom-Party.swf" for example "File:RoomsTown-TheFair2015.swf"  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 18:00, 21 May 2015 (UTC)
*Yes, I agree with this model for uploading new files. Just don't rename old files. --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 00:14, 23 May 2015 (UTC)
**If we want to move the old files, we should first run a PyWikibot replacing the occurences of the old name to the new name (I'm working on doing something like this for the already moved files)  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 08:12, 23 May 2015 (UTC)

Can some admin please fix the links at ''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[template:Main-CPWN|Main-CPWN]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>''? The link to shops doesn't have <nowiki><span class="plainlink></nowiki> and the link to the protocol wiki is missing a space.
