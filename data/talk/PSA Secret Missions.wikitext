== 2007 Club Penguin Missions ==

Has anyone found the 2007 version of the PSA Missions? (Shown in this video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bod5dRAu7LI) --[[User:Thestickman391|Thestickman391]] ([[User talk:Thestickman391|talk]]) 23:13, 9 February 2019 (UTC)

Looks more or less like a bunch of minor interface changes. For the time being, I do not believe they are on Archives. That is, unless you're talking about the old mission select, which can currently be found on [[Forms]]. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 07:14, 13 February 2019 (UTC)
