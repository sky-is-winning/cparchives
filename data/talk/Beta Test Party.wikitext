It's fake, look at the Y, at real pictures of the beta party it is on the black border and on this version there is a little white space between Y and black border. I can upload comparing pictures if you want. Also there are those arrows and some items are black, that is effect, that editing causes.  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 10:41, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

:: I know that I'm late, but I found out that the picture I found is fake... However there are still things proving that the SWF itself is fake. Look at the arrow on the left! See that black border behind it? That's what happens when you edit it with Sothink SWF Quicker  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 11:02, 23 March 2015 (UTC)

== Note About the Beta Test Party Swfs ==

If anyone finds a beta test party town swf make sure it isn't fake first before uploading it. On different club penguin forums people have been submitting what they think are the real beta test party town swfs but the ones they upload are fake. If anyone has the real beta test party town swf upload it. Ask a admin on this wiki to find out whether your beta party town swf is real or fake. -Master Loopy
