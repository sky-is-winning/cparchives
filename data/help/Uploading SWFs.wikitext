==Upload a SWF saved on your Computer==
Uploading SWF, that's saved on your computer is pretty easy. Of course you need to have the [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|Uploader]] permission. If you don't have it, you can request it [[project:Request_permissions|here]].

If you have it, you can continue. First you go to the [[special:upload|Uploading page]] here on the wiki (you can also access it through the toolbox on the left).
