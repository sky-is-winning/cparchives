==FLV files==
Hello Mario,<br />
I wanted to ask if it is possible to upload .flv (flash video) files to the wiki. Here are some flv files by CP:

== erm... ==

Why'd you move the hotel files and cloud forest file? I put them under that title because they're supposedly going to be permanent; and if so then they'd stay looking like that right? <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!

No, I don't think we need a "Swf filter"; just take them off of the pages and leave them to be floating in [[Special:UnusedFiles]] forever, as you can never have too many swfs.

==Bot==
Hi Mario,<br />
May i request flagging [[Special:Contributions/Syster|Syster]] as a bot, and also giving it uploader rights? There's this upload script that i've been testing which works pretty well, though it really floods the RC, so it hought that making a bot instead is a better idea.<br />

I uploaded the files for [[Club Penguin Times/452|issue 452]] of the cp times, but have just realized that the page is under construction by you. Anyway, try perhaps importing [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/w/index.php?oldid=19815 this script]. It's still not finished, but it may save you some time and possible a headache or two.<br />

== Removal of Category:SWFs of Club Penguin ==

I propose to remove Category:SWFs of Club Penguin for the same reason [[clubpenguinwiki:Category:Club Penguin|Category:Club Penguin]] was removed on the Club Penguin Wiki: it's redundant.

== Can't upload file on Parties and Events ==

The headline sayes it self. And by the way, do I have to edit the .swf file before oploading?

== Club Penguin Times ==

Do you still work on that article? I converted all the old news to table and also added some issues I uploaded [[User:Lisured/Club_Penguin_Times]]. --[[User:Lisured|Lisured]] ([[User talk:Lisured|talk]]) 00:21, 27 October 2014 (UTC)

== Removal of uploaders + theme customization ==

Hello Mario Rk, how are you?

I see you and Nando have been removing the uploader rights from inactive users. I'm not here to complain about it, but I think this shouldn't be done. Uploader rights should be given to anyone who can be trusted, so, in my opinion, it doesn't make sense to demote inactive users, since they could eventually come back and not be able to upload files. It's different than administrators, who have an important role on the Wiki and therefore can't become inactive.

By the way, what do you think of the new sidebar? I tried to make the layout match the ones from the other Wikis of CPWN. Do you think something should be changed? Thank you!

== Duplicated File Removal ==

Hello, I've noticed you removed the Portuguese Underwater Expedition Maze Map... for this reason: "duplicated file" May you provide me with a link to the original one?  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 00:37, 12 April 2015 (UTC)

== Moving files ==

Hello Mario. I'm leaving this message just to notify you that moving files here breaks some links on the Club Penguin Wiki PT (e.g. http://pt.clubpenguinwiki.info/wiki/Festa_dos_Puffles_2012/SWF). Is there a way to move them without breaking links? --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 01:05, 15 April 2015 (UTC)

== Town File Links ==

Hi, Mario.

It looks like the file links for the Town SWF are broken on quite a few party pages after you renamed the files. Would you be able to use a bot to fix the broken links?

== Request ==

Hey Mario, I applied for 'Uploader Rights' a few days ago and was wondering if you could check out the request when you have the chance.  Much appreciated. {{Unsigned|Matthewvacc}}

== RE: Request ==

Thanks mate, I'll begin uploading as soon as I finish organizing and categorizing this large mass of junk on my computer. {{Unsigned|Matthewvacc}}

==Request Page==
Hello, Mario.

Can you please check the [[Club Penguin Archives:Request permissions|Request permissions]] page and respond to the requests for uploader rights? An admin has not processed any requests there since November 2015, and there have been 5 new ones since then. I tried leaving [[User:Nando144|Nando144]] a message in February to check the page, but he seems to be inactive. This is one of the largest databases for Club Penguin files, and I'm sure many people use it, so it doesn't make sense that there are so few contributors. As such, any chance for potential new uploaders here would be great, but there needs to be someone approving the requests.

Thanks,

== Paint By Numbers ==
Don't know if this is the ''best'' place in the world to ask, but I just wanted to know if anyone has uploaded the paint by letters .SWFs yet.
I found "Lime Green Dojo Clean" with a quick google and archive.org visit, and wasn't sure if that would be an ok thing to upload.

== New Club Penguin Todo Proposed ==

Hi Mario,

I've recently added a new topic to the Club Penguin To-do Archive talk page. If you could take a look at it ASAP that would be great. 

Riyita recently made some 2005 - 2010 SWF files public on Club Penguin Space.

Cheers.

Tester1234

EDIT: I've looked through recent changes and realised this is already being done. My bad :)

== cpcheats.info mirror question ==
Some parties on the archives have links which redirect you to the cpcheats.info mirror's link, what I mean is that the .swf files are not locally uploaded onto the archives, so am I allowed to upload the .swf files onto here and replace the cpcheats.info mirror link with the locally uploaded .swf file? Sorry if I sound confusing but if you want to get a better idea of what I mean, check out Christmas Party 2007 page. Some .swf files on that page don't have their .swf files uploaded onto the archives and are just a redirecting link to the cpcheats.info mirror
Thanks!

Where did you find [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/wiki/Special:Log/upload?user=Mario_Rk&offset=201712140042&limit=23 these] files? Also, do you have the SWF of the Coffee Shop during the Valentine's Day Celebration? It had a "Happy Valentine's Day!" sign taped to the window.

--[[User:Kawkeetcp|Kawkeetcp]] ([[User talk:Kawkeetcp|talk]]) 06:54, 13 December 2017 (UTC)

Well, wherever they're from, release more if you can. It's good to see history like this being uncovered after all these years.

== Stuff ==

*Save the Migrator- Jan-March 2008 right? Idk if it started before or after Fiesta
*CPIP- Sometime before April Fools Day
*Egg Hunt 2008- Easter Was March 23rd, so likely after the St Patty's Day Party
*Earthquake- Was concurrent with one mission over the summer, maybe Mysterious Tremors? 
*Boat Scavenger Hunt- No idea
*Storm- Sometime in October, either before or after the Anniversary. After, I believe, concurrent with the Halloween Party. 
*Dig Out the Dojo & Grand Re-Opening, between Halloween and Christmas
*Coins for Change- With Christmas Party

*Snow Sculpture Showcase- March 2009, After St Patty's. Started the same day as the Penguin Play Awards, and finished after the end of the April Fools Party. (Looked this one up)
*Egg Hunt- After April Fools
*101 Days of Fun- Started June 4
*2009 Color Vote- July 2009, started after the Music Jam and finished on the same day. 
*Fire Scavenger Hunt- Right after The Fair ended.
*Storm 2009- Probably concurrent with Halloween, and visible in the binoculars sooner.
*Celebration of Fire- Right before the Winter Party.

Hope this helps a little bit. ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 03:48, 22 December 2017 (UTC)

== 2006 Swfs ==

Can you please reveal the source of where you are getting these? I want to see if there is anymore of them. {{Unsigned|MasterLoopy}}

== Party Rooms page ==

Would you mind if I just linked all of the party room pages to "[[Party Rooms]]"? I like the table MasterLoopy set up- but I think it'd be fine if the links to actual room pages were replaced with the swf links. The only ones that might warrant pages of their own are rooms that showed up at multiple parties (and have multiple swfs), but again they'd all still be pretty easy to find on this page so..

P.S. I don't know what else I could do to help on archives since there's a lot. Is there anything specific you can think of that might also be easy for a <s>lazy</s> languorous person like me?

== Does your source have this swf? ==

I was wondering if the anonymous source you have has the beta test party swfs from 2005. Also could you upload all those swfs that you got from your anonymous source to google drive? {{Unsigned|MasterLoopy}}

== How many more swfs do you have left to upload? ==

How many more of those swfs you were given do you have to upload now? What number of them? {{Unsigned|MasterLoopy}}

==Broken File Links==
Hi, Mario. There appears to be a recurring problem of you moving files without leaving redirects and not updating all file links. As you can guess, this results in broken file links on pages, which can be inconvenient for anyone trying to view or save files from the wiki.

Do you know about [[Special:WhatLinksHere]]? It's a useful feature that allows you to see if a page or file is linked on any pages. To quickly access it, click "What links here" in the "Toolbox" section on the left sidebar. When you move files, please check if there are any pages listed there, and if so, update the file links on those pages.

Now that you know this (or if you already knew), please fix these broken links that you left:
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Village.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Stadium.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Forts.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Plaza.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Pizza.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Dance.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Light.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Berg.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Dock.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Coffee.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Cave.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Beach.swf]]
*[[Special:WhatLinksHere/File:MusicJam2010Party3.swf]]

Also, if you or anyone on the CPWN is good with JavaScript, I recommend modifying [http://dev.wikia.com/wiki/FileUsageAuto-update FileUsageAuto-update] to work with this wiki. Otherwise, if you want something that can quickly check a list of files for broken links, let me know and I can send you a Python script for that.

== Policy ==

I know writing a policy is a lot of work, and I think we unofficially follow the CPW policy, but the CPWN policy doesn't cover any critical things like vandalism, swearing, inappropriate content, etc. So, I think either a bare-bones Archives policy should be written (either copied from or mimicking the CPW's), or maybe just write that most of the CPW's policy pertains to archives too. I know it's not an issue now, but I can just imagine a miron-cats-2014 like situation where someone does clearly wrong things then defends themselves by saying "the policy didn't specifically say x!" (or in this case there is no actual policy).

Is it alright if I use the room swfs from here in a Club Penguin Room SWFs Collection I made? I gave credit in that zip file into a text file called Credit.txt. -LoopyTheHedgehog

Btw where did you get those 70 normal room swfs at? -LoopyTheHedgehog

I found some 2005 to 2006 swfs we probably don't have. https://mega.nz/#!cwJ1wQ7Y!2ghZJDBgvXHdIP-zDBmrqDpkK_Q3DXoYUG-nPigOdQA Look in the Artwork folders. {{Unsigned|LoopyTheHedgehog}}

To be on the safe side I don't think we should upload files from that Mega Link on here since there is too much fake stuff in it and I myself included some of the room swfs from that in my zip file. I will take those out of the zip file I made. {{Unsigned|LoopyTheHedgehog}}
