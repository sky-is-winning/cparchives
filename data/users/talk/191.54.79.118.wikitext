==Welcome==
Hello, welcome to the Archives! Thank you for your [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/w/index.php?title=Plaza&type=revision&diff=65671&oldid=64744 edits] at [[Plaza]], however we'd appreciate, if you'd link to an archived SWF there, rather than the current one from CP's servers. The reason is, that the SWFs won't stay like this forever, and for viewing the current SWFs we have the "''Current''" section. Also feel free to create an account here, if you haven't done so, and [[Club_Penguin_Archives:Request_permissions|request the uploader permissions]] (after you create the account, also don't worry, they accept almost everybody), so you can upload SWFs to the archive. Also, when editing, please use the "''Show preview''" button, people don't like, when there are 10 edits made in 5 mins by the same person, that thing would save you time, and you won't do that many edits. If you have any questions, please ask. [[user_talk:misabr|me on my talk page]], or an [[project:administrators|admin]]. 

Here are some other tips written down by [[project:administrators|our admins]]
{{Welcome}} {{User:Misabr/sig2}} 00:53, 14 June 2015 (UTC) P.S. I'm currently working on a guide how to upload SWFs here, but it's nowhere near finished, if you want I can give you the link later.
