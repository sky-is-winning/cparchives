== New rooms ==

I have to ask! Where did you get those party swfs from?  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 15:57, 17 January 2014 (UTC)
Sorry, I have been looking at Prehistoric Party 2013 instead of 2014. I still don't feel like it's new year  {{user:Misabr/sig2}} 15:57, 17 January 2014 (UTC)

==Typo==
Hey, Nando.

First off, I wanted to thank you for all the work you do regarding the updates. You're a huge help! Second, I just wanted to let you know that you've made a typo [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/w/index.php?title=Template:Main-FSWF&curid=4580&diff=24519&oldid=22031 here]. (It seems you've duplicated the word "SWF".) The page is protected, so I'm not able to fix it myself.

Have a good day,

==Request Page==
Hi, Nando.

Just wanted to leave a reminder to check the [[Club Penguin Archives:Request permissions|Request permissions]] page, as it appears that an admin hasn't looked at it in months.

Thanks,
