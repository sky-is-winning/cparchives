They're SWF elements of the Treasure Book. That doesn't mean you'll be able to see the items like the other catalogs since the treasure book is on CP's site rather than in-game. Sorry for the inconvenience, but if you'd like to see what items were in each treasure book be sure to check out the [[clubpenguinwiki:|Club Penguin Wiki]]. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
