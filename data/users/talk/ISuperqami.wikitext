==Water Party 2008==
Hi, ISuperqami.

Regarding your edit [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/wiki/Club_Penguin_Archives:Request_uploader_permissions?diff=91576&oldid=91529 here], the [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/swf.cpcheats.info/rooms/2008/Water_Party_08/ Water Party 2008 folder] on the cpcheats.info mirror is actually mislabeled. The SWFs in that folder are from the [[Submarine Party]]. Anyway, just wanted to let you know. I hope you are able to get the uploader permission.

Yeah, after checking the swfs fully I realized it was the submarine party, my bad. But still if I can find swfs which are original and are not here, I'll do my best to upload 'em here, after I get permissions of course. Thanks!

== RE: cpcheats.info mirror question ==

I know what you mean, some of the links do indeed redirect to the actual mirror itself. Yes, you are allowed to upload these files from the mirror as long as they aren't already uploaded. Also, I recommend sticking to our format of naming files for our rooms. For example, [[:File:RoomsTown-Marvel2012.swf]] for the Marvel Super Hero Takeover 2012 or [[:File:RoomsTown-MusicJam2011.swf]] for the Music Jam 2011. I believe it's rather self-explanatory. Just make sure that the name you use for the room isn't the room's literal name but rather its "SWF name" like how the Recycling Center is actually the Eco in the files, if you understand what I'm trying to explain.

Happy uploading! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 22:49, 16 May 2017 (UTC)
