==RE: Help==
Hi Emilek! It depends. I'm going to make a guide soon on how to upload SWFs (probably tomorrow), so unfortunately you might have to wait until then (since i'm not really good at verbally explaining things). Sorry for the inconvenience. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!

== Sorry ==

Sorry about that message you sent me the other day. I thought you had already requested uploader permission, and just didn't know how to upload SWFs lol :P 

Anyways, I really appreciate that you uploaded so many SWFs. However, when you edit the actual pages to add the SWFs (like you edited [[Penguin Style]]), please wait until you upload all of the SWFs for that certain thing before you edit the page. I ask that so we don't spam up the recent changes, and also so we don't have a bunch of edits on each page history that could've been shortened to one long edit. :) <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
