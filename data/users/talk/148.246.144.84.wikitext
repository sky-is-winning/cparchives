== Welcome! ==

Hi there, and welcome to Club Penguin Archives! Thanks for the help on the [[Parties & Events]] page! We'd love to have you create an account here so we can identify you easier, but you can still edit as an IP if you'd like. My name is Cp kid (but you can call me CK). If you have trouble with anything, need help or have any questions, feel free to ask me :) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 00:07, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

I appreciate that you're trying to help by expanding our Parties and Events table. However, that is some very complicated coding and the main user working on it (Mario Rk) may not appreciate your help. So, please be warned that your work on that table may be for nothing if he reverts it (so maybe you could work on something different instead). Thanks so much :) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 08:08, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
