== Welcome! ==
Hello, welcome to the Club Penguin Archives! I see you have been editing some pages, so I'm just leaving this message to tell you that you can ask for uploader rights to send files, if you wish. Just make a request on [[Club Penguin Archives:Request permissions|this page]]. If you have any questions, leave a message on my talk page. --[[User:Juca|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:Juca|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discuss√£o/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/Juca|20px]] 02:39, 29 January 2015 (UTC)

==Uploader Rights==
Hi.

I noticed you've been adding non-existent files (specifically music files) to pages in hope that someone else will upload the files for you. I've been uploading them for you so far, but instead, please request uploader rights [[Club Penguin Archives:Request uploader permissions|here]] so that you can upload them yourself.

Thanks,

--[[User:Kawkeetcp|Kawkeetcp]] ([[User talk:Kawkeetcp|talk]]) 07:01, 11 August 2017 (UTC)

Your application has been reviewed and you have promoted as an [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|uploader]]. As an uploader it is your job to upload files from [[wiki:Club Penguin|''Club Penguin'']] prior to its closing.

To get you started, here are some basic things we'd thought you'd like to know:

*'''Upload''' - To upload a file, click on "Upload file" on the sidebar under the toolbox section. From there you can either choose to upload from your computer or upload from a source URL. Before submitting your file, be sure to select the appropriate licensing, if any. Finally, click on "upload file" button and your file will be added to our database.
*'''To-do list''' - If you want to help Club Penguin Archives to become the best it can be, we recommend helping us out with the to-do list which can be found [[Club Penguin Archives:To-do List|here]]!
