== Welcome to Archives! ==

Hi Octopus, and welcome to Club Penguin Archives! My name is Cp kid, but i'd prefer you calling me CK :P I'm a resident bureaucrat and administrator here, so if you need any help or have questions, feel free to ask me :) Your request for uploader rights has been acknowledged and completed- you can now upload SWFs to the database. 

As I said earlier, if you need help with anything or have any questions, feel free to ask me (or another administrator). I hope to see you around! :)

P.S.- We actually want to upload and organize as many Russian SWFs as possible before it's official release, because most are exclusive SWFs that won't even appear on Russian CP when it's released (so we don't want to risk losing them forever!) So, your edit(s) organizing the SWFs earlier were quite helpful.
