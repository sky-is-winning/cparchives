Hi CP Kid,<br/>
I saw you requested uploader user right. If you get it, you can save an SWF by opening the file (in this case, Club Penguin's SWF file), click '''Ctrl+S''', and i recommend saving it to your desktop or another file that will be easy to find later when uploading the file to the wiki.<br/>
P.S. if you can't click '''Ctrl+S''', try to click the URL bar and then try again.<br/>

==How to find files+ List==
The best thing to do is to open a new tab, and in the URL bar type in '''about:cache''' When you enter CP, if you refresh the '''about:cache''' ticket, it will show you the recent files opened in your computer. if you open  a catalog, for example, it will show you the catalog's swf. same with clothing items when you open your player card (the item's "icons" and "paper" swf) or when you enter a room ("sprites" swf files). It also shows music swf.<br/>
When you click the recent links in your cache, it will probably give you a link like this:
*'''<nowiki>chrome://view-http-cache/http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/icons/1341.swf</nowiki>'''
This URL contains extra parts, so you can simply remove them (marked in bold):
*'''<nowiki>chrome://view-http-cache/</nowiki>'''<nowiki>http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/icons/1341.swf</nowiki>
So it will look like this:
*<nowiki>http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/icons/1341.swf</nowiki>
I also added a short list of some swf:
*[http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/icons/1341.swf Clothing items (icons)]
*[http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/sprites/1341.swf Clothing items (sprites)]
*[http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/paper/1341.swf Clothing items (paper)]
*[http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/en/catalogues/clothing.swf Catalog (penguin style)]
*[http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global//music/1.swf Music (coffee shop)]
You can also find more swf [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/.swf here].<Br/>

== Misunderstanding? ==

When I asked for SWFs to be moved to the Archives Wiki, I didn't really want the current SWF to be moved as well. I only wanted the old ones moved, or "archived". Now apparently I'm looking for the current CP Town SWF from clubpenguin.com and it's on neither wiki. This is a major inconvenience and could cost the CPW in some traffic. --[[File:FlagCanada.svg|20px|border|link=User talk:LordMaster96]]<font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:LordMaster96|<span style="color:#ce1126">Lord</span><span style="color:#002b7f">Master</span><span style="color:#ffd600">96</span>]]</font> 04:37, 15 November 2012 (UTC)

== RE: Newspaper ==

Aww crap!! I'm sorry, I thought that I had done something great... <b>:'(</b>

I apologize for the burdensome duplicity. Can you at link the stuff back onto the [[Operation Blackout]] page like I had it, for the public to view?

(Or, alternately, can you use my version of the SWFs instead of the other guy's paper? I was really proud of finding all of that........)

== Saving SWF files ==

So, how would I go about saving a SWF file form the game? --[[User:Imdill3|Imdill3]] ([[User talk:Imdill3|talk]]) 07:06, 26 November 2012 (UTC)

== Room SWFs in different languages. ==

This is pretty complicated stuff you're going to read here. So beware.

First of all, I don't know if you know it or not, but actually, all CP SWFs are in all languages. Some, which have a more severe password, blink the languages, the others do not. However, to achieve the SWFs in only one language, they must be edited, so that you replace all the other languages with one certain language. It's not too easy however, because the older English logos and stuff are all bigger than the newer language logos and stuff.

No they won't always look like that. For one the quest papers in the lobby, and the cannon at the top of the hotel says Members only, so maybe in the future it won't be only for members. Some things CAN change. Just saying.

==Table alignment==
Hi Ck,<br />
I notice that the wiki deals with multiple table alignments, especially on room articels or pages that contain links of files in different languages.<br />
Currently the alignment is done using the '''&lt;center&gt;''' element, but in case you'd like a more officiant way for it, you can add to the table a class called '''center''', and add to the [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common.css]] page:
<pre>
/* table centering */
table.center {
	margin: auto;
}
</pre>
I think it will save you some uneeded extra markup (also the '''&lt;center&gt;''' tag is deprecated).<br />

For the family file, you do "python generate_family_file.py", it will guide you through the process...
