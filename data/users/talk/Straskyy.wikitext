Your application has been reviewed and you have promoted as an [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|uploader]]. As an uploader it is your job to upload files from [[clubpenguinwiki:Club Penguin|''Club Penguin'']] prior to its closing.

To get you started, here are some basic things we'd thought you'd like to know:

*'''Upload''' - To upload a file, click on "Upload file" on the sidebar under the toolbox section. From there you can either choose to upload from your computer or upload from a source URL. Before submitting your file, be sure to select the appropriate licensing, if any. Finally, click on "upload file" button and your file will be added to our database.
*'''To-do list''' - If you want to help Club Penguin Archives to become the best it can be, we recommend helping us out with the to-do list which can be found [[Club Penguin Archives:To-do List|here]]!

Network downtimes are rough, and unfortunately not in my control.<br>The instructions to upload a file are listed above, I have granted you Uploader permissions for the time being.<br>Since there are a lot of fake Winter Luau files out there, I will review the file when it is uploaded to evaluate whether or not it is legitimate.<br>Thanks for contributing, and if you have any other questions be sure to reach out (if possible)! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 23:48, 23 August 2020 (UTC)
