== RE: Permission ==

While permission isn't required, it is highly appreciated! So yes, it's perfectly fine if you want to use Archives's files for your zip file. Thanks for asking nonetheless! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 13:56, 13 September 2019 (UTC)


The files uploaded were provided by a trusted anonymous donor.

As for the files you've provided, I am not entirely sure how reliable they are, or where they came from. They contain data for items that should not have existed in the time period implied by the folder names, such as the [[cpw:I Heart Pizza T-Shirt|I Heart Pizza Shirt]]'s dance animation, the animation for the Water Ninja dance and even the [[cpw:Thunder Blade|Thunder Blade]] just to name a few. Also included in those files was a penguin wielding a gun, complete with gunshot sound effects and an edited fallen over Sled Racer penguin with a headshot wound. I'm still going through them to deduce whether or not the room files, or anything else is worth salvaging. Though, I don't want to sound ungrateful, I just want you to be aware of where your files come from to prevent situations like the Halloween Party 2005's Town having been a fake for years.

As always, thank you for contributing to Club Penguin Archives!  --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 04:56, 15 September 2019 (UTC)


Unfortunately for you, I have never collected custom CPPS files. I have only ever collected files for Club Penguin Archives, so a natural result of that is tossing aside anything I suspect of being a fan-made file. Good luck on your collection though! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 05:38, 21 September 2019 (UTC)


Not entirely sure how credible they would be given their YouTube channel. Do you know if they specified that these were original unaltered Club Penguin files, or that they wouldn't be duplicates of what already is on Archives? I don't mean to prematurely cast doubt, though usually if people are looking to share their files they leave them somewhere off-site or upload the files directly onto Archives. Nonetheless I appreciate you keeping an open eye for potential opportunities! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 17:47, 30 November 2019 (UTC)
