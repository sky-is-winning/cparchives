Nice! I'm always welcoming to more Archives mirrors. I'll put a link to that mirror on the main page, since the previous Frosty mirror went down.<br>Even so, you should be aware that as long as I know this iteration of Archives is up, I'll continue to maintain it. Hope it's not too much of a bother, but thanks for what you're doing nonetheless! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 02:34, 27 May 2021 (UTC)
