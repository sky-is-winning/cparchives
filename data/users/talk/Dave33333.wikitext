==Welcome to Club Penguin Archives!==
Hi Dave33333! I'm Cp kid, an admin and B-crat here, and I just wanted to formally welcome you to Club Penguin Archives, one of the largest Club Penguin SWF databases in the world! If you need help with anything or have questions, feel free to ask any of the wiki's [[Project:Administrators|administrators]], since they know their way around the wiki :) <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!

Rights: I don't think you will get accepted, you uploaded only 1, 2 or a few more SWFs on the wiki. --[[User:Penstubal|<span style="color:blue"></span><span style="color:#1B6BF5">Penstubal</span>]] [[User talk:Penstubal|<span style="color:#A11BF5">Chat!</span>]] | <span style="color:#787274"> Got Lemonade?</span> 19:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)

Penstubal... Anybody who wants the uploader right will get it unless they're a vandal or something, which Dave isn't. BTW dave, I just gave you uploader rights :) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 22:37, 18 November 2013 (UTC)
