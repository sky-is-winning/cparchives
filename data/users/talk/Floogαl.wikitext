== RE: Catalogs 2015 Onwards ==

After July 2015, the browser Club Penguin game switched to the same database for catalogs as the Club Penguin app at the time, which basically used PNG images instead of SWF files. We actually do have some of the catalog app files after the switch, but they are mostly unsorted in the [[:Category:Catalogs|Catalogs category]] instead of properly being displayed on a page. Hope this helped! --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 19:48, 24 June 2020 (UTC)

The Lodge Attic was changed for The Fair 2014, though it was exactly identical to its appearance and coding to the one from the 2012 Ultimate Jam. Assets would sometimes be reused in situations where the sky was changed to a different color across the island, and this would be one of those cases. As a result, instead of uploading an exact duplicate, we just chose to link to the same pre-uploaded file. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 19:46, 16 July 2020 (UTC)

Hello, I'm not sure how far you got in your own mirror project though I thought I'd let you know about another interactive mirror of Archives which now exists over at [https://archives.frosty.gg archives.frosty.gg]. While there is no official Archives discord, the hosts of the Frosty mirror have their own discord server which can be found at [https://go.frosty.gg/discord go.frosty.gg/discord], where I'll be able to more easily communicate with you in the IRC room specifically. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 23:03, 20 January 2021 (UTC)
