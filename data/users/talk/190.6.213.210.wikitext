==Welcome!==
Hi, and welcome to Club Penguin Archives! I saw that you're trying to help us expand our SWF database, and that's fantastic! But unfortunately, that SWF from the Summer Party 2006 was fake. 

If you'd like to [[Special:CreateAccount|create an account]] here, then you could request the "uploader" right and help us expand our database even more! Plus, If you create an account here, you can also use the same account (without making a new one) on any other wiki in the Club Penguin Wiki Network (including the [[clubpenguinwiki:|Club Penguin Wiki]], [[ptwiki:|Club Penguin Wiki Portuguese]], Club Penguin Fanon Wiki and Club Penguin Shops). However, if you'd like to remain editing as an IP, that is quite alright too :)

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to ask me or another [[Project:Administrators|administrator]] (you can ask me on my [[User talk:Cp kid|talk page]]). I hope you enjoy Archives :) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 09:43, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
