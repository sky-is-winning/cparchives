To get you started, here are some basic things we'd thought you'd like to know:

*'''Upload''' - To upload a file, click on "Upload file" on the sidebar under the toolbox section. From there you can either choose to upload from your computer or upload from a source URL. Before submitting your file, be sure to select the appropriate licensing, if any. Finally, click on "upload file" button and your file will be added to our database.
*'''To-do list''' - If you want to help Club Penguin Archives to become the best it can be, we recommend helping us out with the to-do list which can be found [[Club Penguin Archives:To-do List|here]]!
