==Hi==
Hi Ooga! I deleted the Shadow Dojo page beacuse you had custom-made SWFs on it (we already know that). We don't aim to find what rooms COULD look like. We're solely a place to upload SWFs that are straight from Club Penguin's site (so no rumored SWFs about what things could look like). Sorry for the inconvenience. However, i'd be glad to help you find current SWFs to upload if you'd like (just ask me on my talk page). In additon, If you do decide to help archives by uploading SWFs, just request the uploader rights first [[Project:Request permissions|here]]. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me. :)

P.S.- When you're blocked somewhere (like the Club Penguin Wiki), you're not supposed to create new accounts like this hi hello one, or else you'll get in more trouble. Your oohgabooga is only blocked on the CPW (club penguin wiki) for a few more days, and it isn't blocked here at all. So please use that account instead of this one, since this account is a Sockpuppet (which isnt allowed according to CPW policy). <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
