Hi. [[Special:Contributions/MasterLoopy|MasterLoopy]] left you a message on your user page instead of your talk page. I removed it from your user page and moved it here.

"If you receive uploader permissions make sure to ask the staff on here whether your beta [town] swf is real or fake. Party SWFs can be remakes so be careful with what you upload on here. -Master Loopy"
