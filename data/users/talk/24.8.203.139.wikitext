Hi. You don't technically have to have an account, but i'd prefer it so I could identify you easier :) Anyways, did CPTimes decide you didn't want to partner (since you remove it from that page), or did you just removed it because you don't have an account? Because if you still want to, I can just revert the edit so the section is still there. Also, feel free to check out our [[Special:WebChat|IRC Channel]]. If you could get on there I might be able to talk to you in real-time about making an account where you can change the password :) <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
