== How to Help ==

Hi Wolf,

So you wanna help Archives out? You can do anything! This place is a mess for the most part. Some rooms like the [[Forest]] already have a ton of SWFs uploaded already, although nobody helps to update the page with them. Some parties already have SWFs on the cpcheats.info mirror, although it still claims that they're missing. Basically, there's a lot you can do to help, you can start wherever you'd like! There's plenty of things that need fixing here!
