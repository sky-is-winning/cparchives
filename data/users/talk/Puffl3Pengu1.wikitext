Your application has been reviewed and you have promoted as an [[Special:ListUsers/uploader|uploader]]. As an uploader it is your job to upload files from [[wiki:Club Penguin|''Club Penguin'']] prior to its closing.

To get you started, here are some basic things we'd thought you'd like to know:

*'''Upload''' - To upload a file, click on "Upload file" on the sidebar under the toolbox section. From there you can either choose to upload from your computer or upload from a source URL. Before submitting your file, be sure to select the appropriate licensing, if any. Finally, click on "upload file" button and your file will be added to our database.
*'''To-do list''' - If you want to help Club Penguin Archives to become the best it can be, we recommend helping us out with the to-do list which can be found [[Club Penguin Archives:To-do List|here]]!

== RE: Field Ops Missions files ==

Feel free to create an article for [[Field-Ops]] if you can't find any pages related to those files around Club Penguin Archives. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 20:43, 22 September 2017 (UTC)

== CPPS files ==

I noticed that you've been organizing CPPS files on your userpage as of late, and I wanted to inform you that while Club Penguin Archives may be an archive for all Club Penguin-related files, it is not your personal file storage and wasn't intended for storing files from private servers. I suggest using a free file storage system such as [https://www.mediafire.com/ MediaFire] for your own personal file collections. Just as a heads up, I'll be removing the files a week from now on October 27, 2017, which should give you plenty of time to transfer any files you've uploaded on here. Don't sweat over it though, you're not in any trouble or anything. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 21:46, 20 October 2017 (UTC)
