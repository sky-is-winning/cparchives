== Can't upload file ==

Hello,

When I'm trying to upload a file called "PTNews447SecretOverlay.swf", the following error appears: http://i.imgur.com/HP6w3uQ.png

I have already tried to upload it again a lot of times, but the error always pops up. Could you please help me?

*Update: This is also happening all the time: http://i.imgur.com/PBdJTP3.png --[[User:JucaSLP|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:JucaSLP|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/JucaSLP|20px]] 21:47, 2 June 2014 (UTC)


Still not working. I can't upload the file, but now I get a blank screen instead of an error. It only happens with this specific file. --[[User:JucaSLP|<span style="color:#ff7c00;"><b>Juca</b></span>]] [[User talk:JucaSLP|<span style="color:#c00000;"><b>(discussão/talk)</b></span>]] [[File:Penguinguitar.png|link=Special:Contributions/JucaSLP|20px]] 18:40, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
