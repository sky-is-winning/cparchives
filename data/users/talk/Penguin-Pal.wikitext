That's cool and all, but where do I find the CP SWF files? I have a SWF Decompiler, but idk how to use it :P {{SUBST:Cksig}} 16:04, 9 July 2012 (UTC)

== Umm... ==

Hey P-P. I noticed that you asked HP to delete a file for you. I just wanted to inform you that HP doesn't come on here that often, so it'd probably be better to ask an [[Club Penguin Archives:Administrators|admin]](such as nando or myself). <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!

P.S.- The file has been deleted, so no worries :)

I'm sorry but I am not sure.

*Pink Puffle
*Aqua Grabber and the Penguin

This is NOT the diamond. It was a worm place. :( User:98.177.220.111 (and find the true one please)

Also why you think the amethyst is in the bait swf?

== Thank you penguin-pal ==

Thank you so much. Could I control the Aqua Grabber? [[User:98.177.220.111]]

== Are there is a swf for the catch scene? ==

Ice fishing got a catch scene all the time when you catch the mullet. Are there's a catch scene in this game. And was the penguin dark black or a different color as a swf in Aqua Grabber? [[User:98.177.220.111]] (the other posts are made my me. I typed on 117 by a mistake)

== Do the other games have misc ==

Does the other games have misc. Aqua Grabber has misc but does the other ones also have misc.

The script from cps05box still does not upload. Like before, it shows it is uploading, but actually no file is uploaded. The final result was this: [http://i.imgur.com/5l6GbpU.png]. Adding the new code to my common.js, with the changes I had made, it uploads, but no page is created.
