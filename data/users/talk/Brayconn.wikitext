==RE: Paint by Numbers==
I believe we do have the Paint by Numbers books, although if you find a file you believe hasn't been uploaded on Archives yet, feel free to. The system should detect duplicates and it'll warn you prior to the upload. Files found on archive.org are usually accepted on this wiki, unlike fan made recreations or modified files.
