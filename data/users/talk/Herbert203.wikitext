== RE: I need stars rebels party 2015 client files ==

Unfortunately as a general rule of thumb, if it is not listed on the party page, it likely was not saved to begin with. This seems to be the case with the features and party files. Based on the upload dates, it seems that we weren't aware of the features file until the [[Halloween Party 2015]] at the earliest and though the [[:File:ClientParty.swf|earliest party client file we have]] is dated to June 2014, it wouldn't be regularly archived until [[Operation: Crustacean]]. Just to ensure they weren't lost to time, I checked the [https://web.archive.org/ Wayback Machine] for both of these to no avail. I'm sorry to say that we just don't have either of these, though if you manage to locate them be sure to let me know and I will have them up on Archives in no time! Sorry for the inconvenience. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 23:14, 18 April 2020 (UTC)
