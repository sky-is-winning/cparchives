== Welcome! ==

Misabr, welcome to Club Penguin Archives, one of the largest CP SWF databases there is! If you need any help or have any questions, feel free to ask me or another admin on our talk page. If you'd like the uploader right to help us upload SWF files, you're more than welcome to request it [[Project:Request permissions|here]].

As for your question, no, i'm sorry, but I don't know how to force the unused images to update, nor do I know when it will update. Sorry for the inconvenience :/ ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 10:56, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

== Great user! ==

Hi Misabr! I just wanted to let you know that you're a great editor in my eyes! Not only are you working on projects and uploading SWFs, but you even welcomed a new user and gave them advice! That's great, and I just figured I should tell you that I think you could have a great future on the network if you keep working hard :) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 01:40, 11 January 2014 (UTC)

== Bot rights ==

Hello Misabr. How are you? Well, I'm sending this message to notify you that we admins are not able to give bot rights. To have them, you will need to contact a staff member, like [[clubpenguinwiki:User talk:Seahorseruler|Seahorseruler]].

== RE: ==

Sure. No problem -- happy to see this kind of help for the archives. :)

Have a nice day,

== Wow Ø_Ø ==

A bot would have been '''amazing''' a few years ago when I was trying to upload [[Clothing Icons|these files]]. However if you're going to use the bot to upload those (and/or any other [[Items]] swfs, you should probably finish the ''pages'' before uploading.

Sure, go ahead. I ''think'' what I was going to do was put everything in a table (similar to the clothing icons), with the stamp IDs and swfs, but I never got around to it. You can do whatever you'd like with it.

== Well Done ==

Hey, Misabr.

I've seen your work on [[Clothing Icons]], [[Clothing Sprites]], [[Clothing Paper]], [[Stamps]], and [[Postcards]], and I just wanted to thank you for your contributions. You've made a huge difference with your bot!

Have a nice day,

[[:File:Close upsPTMaze map-UnderwaterExpedition.swf]] was the original file uploaded literally minutes before you uploaded your version.

== Bot? ==

Just curious, what might someone need to make a bot? I'm just curious because I was interested in getting one to perform small tasks on Shops.

For example, changing [[shops:File:413.png|this link]] to [[shops:File:CPPartyHat.png|this link]] on every page the former is located on, as part of "[[shops:Club Penguin Shops:Clean Up Shops 2014|Clean Up Shops 2014]]" (which I never completed). I realized it would be '''much''' easier if I could just use a bot instead of editing hundreds of pages :D 

P.S. In case Google Translate messes this up- I do NOT want you to change links for me, I'm just curious of how to make a bot of my own and how to use it. Thanks :D ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 02:51, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

I went to that manual, downloaded the "nightly" pywiki stuff and the 2.7.9 python. But, I have no idea were to go from here because I can't make that user .py file. Whenever I type the command in it says I need something to ''open'' it. I tried that ''python pwb.py'' code and it said "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file". Plz help :D (I'm not tech-savvy whatsoever :D) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 06:41, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

Lol, I downloaded Python but forgot to ''install'' it. So, I installed it and changed the "path" and whatnot, and now apparently that works. But, how do I make a "custom" user & family file now for the CPWN? The page about it is confusing the daylight out of me. Also, would I have to make a different one for each CPWN wiki, and ''can it even use more than one at a time'', or can it only function on one wiki at a time...

I haven't touched it in a few days, and now I've completely forgotten where I was at (kinda). I know I already installed httplib elsewhere, and it's in my downloads folder. I don't rembmer why I needed it (what step I was at configuring the bot). According to the files, it ''looks'' like I already set up a family file for Shops. It looks like I couldn't create user files... because it's saying "svnversion failed" when I try to do so. What does that mean?

== Broke it? ==

CK Bot was working well for a few hours, replacing image links. However, now it's not working at all.

I tried to replace some image links, but now it's not working at all: 

*I tried '''(r'File:PM Bakers Apron.png', u'File:CPBaker\'sApron.png'),''' in mainspace and that has 0 changes (even though it should have had one change). That's fine, could be a coincidence (because I learned that it doesn't count images if the spaces are_filled_with_underscores.
*However, I also tried '''(r'File:120px-SuperfanHoodie.PNG', u'File:CPSuperfanHoodie.png'),''' on mainspace, user '''and''' user talk namespaces, and got no changes from any of them (and it says it's on 11 pages of the three namespaces). 

So I have no idea what I did, but I guess I broke it somehow :/ ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 05:57, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

'''I'm. So. Dumb.''' Thanks! I wanted to ask though, is there a way to add more "fixes" so I could change more than one imagelink at once. Or, a way to add more replace parameters to the ''example'' fix, to also replace more things at once?

I tried ''''replacements': [ (r'File:PM Bakers Apron.png', u'File:CPBaker\'sApron.png'), (r'File:PM Bakers Apron.png', u'File:CPBaker\'sApron.png') ]''' last night (not that precise code, I had two different files), but it didn't work (well, it ran, but made no changes). So, Idk if that's because I included File: on both of them, or if it's because that is the wrong way to do it. I undid that for now, until you can tell me if it's possible of not (so don't worry about it messing up stuff) ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 17:38, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

IRC if you can for that stuff ^ :P ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 18:16, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

Thanks! Another question :3

I can't get it to detect this for some reason '''File:Gold Viking Helmet clothing icon ID 460 (larger file).png''', I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the parenthesis, but idk what I can do to fix it.

== Party Unknown ==

Hi, Misabr.

The file you uploaded, "CloseUpsRUIgloo prompt-UnknownParty.swf" is actually from the [[Music Jam 2014]] (as you can see [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/File:MusicJam2014TourBusIgloosList3.png here]), but the igloo prompt for that party wasn't archived. What it was doing in their files during this time of year, I have no idea. Maybe Club Penguin planned to re-use it for the SoundStudio Party, but ended up never using it, like with the quest interface.

Anyway, have a good day,

== New Files ==

Hi, Misabr.

I see that it has been over a month since you last used [[User:MisabrBot|your bot]] to upload [[clothing]] item files. Can you please upload the new ones?

Thanks,

== Game Closing ==

Hello,

Please read this important announcement if you haven't yet:

http://www.clubpenguin.com/whats-new/important-announcement-regarding-club-penguin-desktop-and-mobile-devices

Club Penguin will unfortunately be discontinued on '''March 29, 2017''', which means that we have until then to archive everything possible. It would be a great help if you could spare some time and use your bot to archive files before the game closes.

Thank you.

==Beach page to the new style==
Hey, I read that you wanted to transfer Beach to the new style, I've done a bit of it- if you want to finish it off, feel free to do so!
