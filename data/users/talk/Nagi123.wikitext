== Welcome ==

I've seen you around on the wiki before, so I know you've been here a while. But I noticed your talk page didn't exist... so now it does! Welcome to Archives! If you have any questions about the wiki or anything else, feel free to ask me or the admin (Mario Rk). I hope your time here is productive, and thanks for contributing!

He doesn't. If he did, he would have uploaded them by now, sorry. But there's still plenty of SWFs to upload! ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 13:43, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
