== Welcome! ==

Hi Kaweet, and welcome to Archives! I see you already have the uploader right, which is a great start here. I promise, there's always plenty of articles to be fixed/expanded, and plenty of SWFs to be uploaded. Although I'm not an administrator, feel free to message me on my [[User talk:Cp kid|talk page]] if you have any questions, concerns, or comments about anything- I know my way around the site pretty well so hopefully I'll be able to help you in any way possible :)

Once again, welcome to Archives! I hope you enjoy your stay here, however long it may be. ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 03:34, 10 July 2014 (UTC)

== Wow ==

Hi Kaweet. I saw that you uploaded a bunch of old newspapers, and I wanted to say how awesome that is! In addition, I'm curious, where did you find them (if you don't mind my asking)?

== RE: MiniGame Template ==

Sorry, I had to redirect the template you make to the one that already exists [[Template:GameSWF]]. It just wasn't on the licensing template.

== RE:File Display Glitch ==

Hello, Kawkeetcp.

This is actually very common, it happens all the time. It's a cache problem with Club Penguin Wiki/Cloudflare, so there isn't much to do about it besides waiting for the files to update, which usually takes some hours. A way to test if the upload was successful is adding a "?" to the end of the direct URL of the file (e.g. "http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/static/images/archives/b/b3/PuffleParty2015PreVillage.swf" would become "[http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/static/images/archives/b/b3/PuffleParty2015PreVillage.swf? http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/static/images/archives/b/b3/PuffleParty2015PreVillage.swf?]"). If the new file appears, it's a cache problem from the site and you will have to wait.

== Re: Alternate Catalog ==

No problem, I usually update my personal archive on Sundays so I should have most of the stuff. I am just glad that Misabr uploaded the original version, which I don't have. Also thanks for helping us with the [[Rainbow Puffle Party]]. --[[User:Lisured|Lisured]] ([[User_talk:Lisured|会話]]) 07:35, 2 June 2015 (UTC)

== Re: Room Files ==

Those were recreations?  Wow sorry man, my friend had sent me those and I had no idea of their origin.  Leads me to think what else I have that might not be legitimate...  How could you tell, I have to look into the other things I have before I upload them.

Alright thanks for the intel, I'll be sure to use it to my advantage while looking over some of my files.  I do however have a few files in question such as the Cave (2006) and Lighthouse (2006).  I'm almost completely sure they're legitimate, but to be safe do you think you should scan them over first?

Apologies. I am not very active on CPWN all that much. The best way to contact me is with [[Special:EmailUser/Tux|email]].

Hello, Kawkeetcp. Unfortunately, I stopped archiving in March and won’t be able to return from hiatus sooner than May 2017.

Happy Holidays to you too.

I still follow Club Penguin news. And even if I didn’t, it was everywhere ☺

I have archived the February catalogues. If there is something else I could do, let me know.

The files came from an anonymous source, the files definitely are genuine however.

== RE: Broken File Links ==

I'm very aware that a ton of links are broken right now. I'm currently trying to rename some non-conforming party room files to fit in with a standard I'm trying to set up across the wiki. While doing this, I'm also hoping to update other room pages to use [[Town Center]]'s party template. Since this is going to be a long process, and I'm going to fix it anyway, I figured I may as well get the moving over with so I can mass-fix the links later. It's something I've been meaning to do for a long time, and I've finally decided to just go for it even though it'll be a messy process. I'm hoping to finish this within the next day or so, or at least get past the mass-moving phase. For now I stopped since I don't have any time right now to continue it for tonight. And yeah, I've known about Special:WhatLinksHere for a long time. The mass-mover thing looks interesting and might be worth adding, could probably ask someone to look into it. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 08:55, 12 January 2018 (UTC)

It's been a long and slow process, eventually I hope to make time to get to them - there's just so many issues with Archives I'm kind of juggling them on top of other responsibilities. There are definitely still plans to fix them though. --[[User:Mario Rk|'''<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">Mario Rk</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(T)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mario Rk|<span class="Xc6" style="color:#FF0000;">(C)</span>]]</sup> 03:34, 14 June 2018 (UTC)


That's nice of you to notice they're still broken, but why don't you just fix them? People have lives and are busy, not to mention it's hard for pretty much one person (Mario) to maintain an entire wiki on their own, so give him a break. Everybody who visits the wiki could do a little more to help out, myself included, but hardly anyone does and that's why the wiki is still so unorganized and outdated in some parts, with broken links, over [[Special:UnusedFiles|1,000 files]] not linked to any pages, etc. ''<big><font face="trebuchet ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:red">C</span>]][[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue">K</span>]]</font></big>'' 10:32, 17 June 2018 (UTC)

I believe you took my message the wrong way. I simply asked for a status update after the help that I provided him months ago.

An essential part of moving wiki pages that are linked on other pages is to either (1) leave redirects or (2) update the links to those pages. Mario was doing neither, which resulted in broken links on pages. This is easily avoidable by him and shouldn't have to be debated.

To answer your question about why I'm not fixing his broken links anymore, it's because I've ''been'' fixing them for years now. I believe that he is capable of cleaning up after himself, so I'm choosing to no longer fix them for him. However, I was still nice and took the time to provide information that can help him fix broken links.

As for your last statement, I too wish that more people would contribute to this wiki (which is also what I've been doing for years). However, despite the state of the wiki, I don't believe that adding to the problem by intentionally leaving broken links on pages is the right choice. To be fair to Mario though, he did reply and say that he plans to fix them.
