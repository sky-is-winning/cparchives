==Welcome!==
Hi there, welcome to Archives! The "request permissions" page is actually for users who want the uploader right (which allows them to upload SWFs here), however i'd be more than glad to try and help you out :) Unfortunately the SWF isn't available on that link anymore because CP Staff must have deleted the SWF or something, and I don't see it on our SWF database anywhere. But i'll see if I can help you any by looking for it on other SWF containing sites tomorrow after I get out of school. Message me back on [[User talk:Cp kid|my userpage]] any time you'd like, and have a great day! 

P.S.- Please, feel free to make an account on Archives, we'd love to have you! the account would also be valid for the other wikis in the Club Penguin Wiki Network (the network archives is part of), including [[clubpenguinwiki:|the Club Penguin Wiki]], [http://shops.clubpenguinwiki.info Club Penguin Shops], and the [[fanon:|Club Penguin Fanon Wiki]]. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
