== Hi ==

Hi Agent 118, welcome to Club Penguin Archives! You couldn't edit the [[Parties & Events]] page because you aren't an autoconfirmed user yet. To become an autoconfirmed user you have to have around 10 edits(?) and have been on Archives for two days. And for your other question, no you do not have to edit the SWF before uploading it.
