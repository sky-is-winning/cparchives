|<center>My name is '''Sharkbate'''. I am a staff member on the network and have been here since December 7, 2008. If you have any questions about any wiki currently situated on the network, please feel free to ask. You may see me doing some clean up on the network wikis. You can usually find me on the network's IRC channels:

('''#clubpenguinwiki''', '''#clubpenguinfanon''', '''#clubpenguinwiki-archives''', '''#clubpenguinwiki-shops'''). 

You can leave me a message on my talk page or email me at '''sharkbate@clubpenguinwiki.info'''. Have a nice day!
