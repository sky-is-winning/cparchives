Hi! I'm CK, a former administrator and bureaucrat of Club Penguin Archives. If you would like to help upload SWFs to this wiki, go [[Club Penguin Archives:Request permissions|here]]. If you need help with anything else, or have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page or [[User:Mario Rk|Mario's]]. -CK
