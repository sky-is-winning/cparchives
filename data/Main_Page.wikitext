                    <br>}} '''1. Why is the original site down?''' :The Club Penguin Wiki Network servers are known to be unstable and frequently go down for unknown reasons. The Network's tech staff are unresponsive and unlikely to bring the site back up again. '''2. Is there a compressed .ZIP download (or equivalent) of every Club Penguin file on this site?''' :Yep! [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12OJCc-pHT-CZB4wInO1gN9df8oVjKr8G|Here's the link. Whilst it's very much unsorted, if you want to keep a local copy, feel free.] '''3. A file is missing from a page! Can you please upload it?''' :That is a lot easier said than done. While it is true some files were uploaded and are absent from pages, generally if a file is missing from a page, it was never archived or uploaded at all. If a file has been archived, but isn't on a page, your best bet of finding it is in [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14XgRKhd6fb6pCl1rAXCttUTOxBvma4os|this Google Drive folder]. '''4. Is there a Club Penguin Archives Discord?''' :Whilst there's no official Discord server, [https://discord.gg/ser2KbyCwU|this server] , coincidentally also called ‘Club Penguin Archives’, is a great place to talk with community members. '''5. Does Club Penguin Archives host custom files from Club Penguin Private Servers (CPPS)?''' :Archives is only intended to host files from the official Club Penguin game. It's possible that every so often a fan-made file is passed off as an official one, though ideally this should not happen. There is also not any consideration on this becoming a possibility in the future. '''6. Can I help contribute to Club Penguin Archives?''' :If you believe you are in possession of genuine Club Penguin files that aren't on Archives yet and wish to upload them, please make a pull request at [https://github.com/sky-is-winning/cparchives|the mirror's repo] and include the file you want uploaded.</div>
