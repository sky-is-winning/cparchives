== Riddles Answers parameter ==

Can an admin please add a parameter for the riddles answers files as I've done [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/wiki/Template:Newspaper?diff=77315&oldid=63474 here]? The files are not present in every newspaper issue, but for the ones they are present in, they are sometimes used as what the name implies (see [http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/en/news/papers/20131127/content/overlays/riddlesAnswers.swf here]) and other times used as secret notes (see [http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/en/news/papers/20131106/content/overlays/riddlesAnswers.swf here]).
