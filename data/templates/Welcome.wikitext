Hi there! Welcome to the Club Penguin Archives, the free online encyclopedia all about Club Penguin! We hope you enjoy your stay here.

To get you started on the wiki, here are some basic things we'd thought you'd like to know:
*'''Edit''' - To edit an article, simply click the 'edit' button at the top of the page. Editing is the act of changing a page. Your knowledge is the main reason why we are a large website. Articles are our most important pages that are informative and have information on different things on ''Club Penguin''.
*'''User page''' - All users have their very own user page, or "profile". Your user page is your very own page, where you can describe yourself. Feel free to fill out [[Special:MyPage|your user page]] with information about yourself, and anything else you would like to say.
*'''User talk''' - Every user in this wiki has a talk page, which enables you to communicate with other users, even if they're not online. They can send messages to you, while you can too through the talk page. You can add your signature by typing 4 tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>). You can also click the [[File:Sigtime.png]] button on the edit bar to do the same thing. 
*'''IRC (Chat)''' - The wiki has an IRC Channel, which can used to chat with other users in the wiki. You can meet your friends there, make new friends and ask for help if needed. The admins are usually active in IRC, it can be an easy way to get help from them. Click [[Special:WebChat|here]] to join our IRC chat. Please note joining our IRC channel will also automatically join you to the #ClubPenguinWiki IRC Channel as well.
*'''Others''' - If you want to check out the to-do list and work on some archives-related projects, click [[Club Penguin Archives:To-do List|here]]!

You can also modify some of your account settings such as your signature at [[Special:Preferences|Preferences]].
