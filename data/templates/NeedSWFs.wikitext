===Explanation===
This [[:Category:Templates|template]] was designed to serve the purpose of an article message box that alerts readers to the absence of certain relevant files from a page. While the only parameter is optional, it is highly recommended to use it for better clarification. If it is not, and there is no evidence that the page is missing any relevant files, the template may be removed.

<code>{{NeedSWFs</code> - Opening of template.<br>
<code>|1=</code> - Identify the exact files that are missing from the page.<br>
<code>}}</code> - Closing of template.
