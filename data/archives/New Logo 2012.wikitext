Hello CPA community! We're going to have a new logo for Archives starting on our 2nd anniversary- December 12th, 2012. However, we need a new logo! So, if you'd like to create a logo design and submit it below, then go ahead! 

==Rules==
*It must be 150x144 px '''OR''' 150x150 px. If you want you can use one of the blank images on the right as a base, and add to it. [[File:BlankLogo1.png|right|thumb|Blank Logo- dimensions 150x144px.]][[File:BlankLogo2.png|right|thumb|Blank Logo- dimensions 150x150 px.]]
*It must be turned in by December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2012. 
*You can enter as many designs as you'd like.
===Design rules===
*It must feature a "Club Penguin" logo, and the word "Archives" somewhere on the logo.
*However, do NOT have "disney" with the Club Penguin logo, because we are not directly "related" to disney in any way.
*It's not really a rule, but it would be better if the logo was transparent. However, if you don't know how to make an image transparent then just leave it with the white background. 

==Submissions==
Feel free to submit any and all designs you may have below. The format is shown in the example below- your username and the image size(150x144px or 150x150px).
