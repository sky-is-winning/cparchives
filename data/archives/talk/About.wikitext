Don't you think the history section is way too CK-oriented? It says "Cp kid" in there 4 times, mainly for things that would be insignificant things on another site :| --{{SUBST:Template:BroSig}} 13:32, 17 December 2012 (UTC)

I kinda agree, but I don't really know much else archives history from pre-2012 :P So make a user sub-page with what you think it should look like, and if it's better then i'll chnge it. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk! ''</span>]] </big> 18:52, 17 December 2012 (UTC)
