We host a compressed archive that is an exact replica of the old CPCheats SWF mirror, before it was shut down. [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/swf.cpcheats.info.7z Here] is a 7zip compressed version of the site mirrored with [[wikipedia:wget|wget]]. You can also view it online [http://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/swf.cpcheats.info/ here].

You should only use it for extracting the contained SWFs that are missing from the current archive and putting into it, or alternatively, as a historical resource.
