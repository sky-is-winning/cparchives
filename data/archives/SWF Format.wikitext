This page specifies the current format used for SWF's filenames.

==Catalogs==
For Catalogs, the format for uploading should usually be something like "<language(EN,PT, etc.)>Catalogues<type ("clothing", "light", "party", etc)><Month (if necessary)>.swf".

*So, the SWF name for the August 2012 version of this "http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/en/catalogues/pirate.swf" would be '''File:ENCataloguesPirateAug2012.swf'''. 
*Another example: Nov. 2012 version of "http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/fr/catalogues/clothing.swf" = '''File:FRCataloguesClothingNov2012.swf'''.

*So basically, remember the main points in the original SWF link. If it's directly from CP, then those key points are (in bold)... "http: //media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/local/'''fr'''/'''catalogues'''/'''clothing'''.swf". Also, always have the month if applicable.

==Items==
For Items, the format for uploading should usually be something like "Clothing'''<nowiki>[type of SWF (Icons, Sprites, Paper, Photos)]</nowiki>''<nowiki>[ID]</nowiki>'''''.swf
*So [http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/icons/1.swf http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/'''icons'''/'''1'''.swf] would become [[media:ClothingIcons1.swf|File:Clothing'''Icons1'''.swf]] (note the bold parts)
**Another example: [http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/paper/1337.swf http://media1.clubpenguin.com/play/v2/content/global/clothing/'''paper'''/'''''1337'''''.swf] would become [[media:ClothingPaper1337.swf|File:Clothing'''Paper''1337'''''.swf]] (note the marked parts)

==Rooms==
==Music==
