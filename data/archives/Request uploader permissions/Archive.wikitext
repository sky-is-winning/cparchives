{{Perm|Agent 118|Uploader|Hi! I'm requesting the Uploader permission, because I believe that I'm an experienced downloader. Have been downloading and hunting "lost" flash games (with .xml and .txt files) for the past two years, and at the same time I find it interesting and fun. I love to search for different games and files that I can add in my collection, and therefore I think that I can be to good help for this archive. I just got my hands on the Beta test party town from 2005.}}

{{Perm|Towerofyikk|Uploader|It has come to my attention that this wiki is well... not the best maintained before. And well, there are a whole ton of swf missing as well, a handful of which I am in possession in. In addition to uploading some missing stuff, I also think it might be worth it to take the swfs of archived rooms (at the least) that are just in one language (particularly older swfs, from like 2009-2012) and convert them to English, then make subpages for [[Parties & Events]] where the swfs will be in other languages (if that is okay with the editors here)}}
