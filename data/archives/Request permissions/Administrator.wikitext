<small>[[Project:Request permissions|Back to the main permissions page.]]</small>

This is where you vote to promote a new administrator.

When a request has been completed, successful or not, please archive it '''[[Club Penguin Archives:Request permissions/Administrator/Archive|here]]'''.

==Requirements==
So, you think you have what it takes to be an administrator here? If so, here's how it works for you to get nominated below:

*You must be generally active (more than 150 edits that month).
*You must be a proficient editor (know how to properly upload SWFs, good grammar, etc.).
*You must be partially active for at least three months ('''not''' just make an account, make 150 edits and then try to get nominated).
*There must be 5 or less administrators at the time of your nomination.

If you are compliant with those three categories, you must then ask an administrator to nominate you. If an admin doesn't think you're ready to be nominated for the right, or there are too many administrators at the time, you will not be nominated on this page. However, you can always try again at a different time.
