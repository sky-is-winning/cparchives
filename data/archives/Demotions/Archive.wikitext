===Demote ClubPenguinMaster (+6)===

*If you look at CPM's [[Special:Contributions/ClubPenguinMaster|contributions]], he hasn't even edited archives since November 2012. In addition, I messaged him nearly half a month ago asking him why he wasn't editing and warning him that this vote would be set up if he didn't become more active by today. Needless to say, I haven't received a response yet or seen him on IRC. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!

*First of all, i was kinda inactive myself lately so sorry aobut that XP Anyway, has CPMaster been active in the other CPWN wikis? [[user:Penguin-Pal|<font color="0e92cf">Penguin-Pal</font>]] [[user talk:Penguin-Pal|<font color="2e47aa">(talk)</font>]] 12:51, 2 April 2013 (UTC)
*It's ok because you're not an admin and b-crat here :P Also, his contributions from the CPW can be found [[clubpenguinwiki:Special:Contributions/ClubPenguinMaster|here]], and that's the only other wiki he edits as far as I know. <big><font face="comic sans ms">[[User:Cp kid|<span style="color:blue;background:black">'' Cp kid ''</span>]]</font>[[User talk:Cp kid|<span style="color:lime;background:blue">'' Let's talk!
