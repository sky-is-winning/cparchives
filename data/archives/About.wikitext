{{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|About|
==History==
swf.cpcheats.info, part of a Club Penguin cheats forum and blog, was the primary archive of Club Penguin [[wikipedia:SWF|SWF]] files until the site was taken down in December 2010. [[User:Refractor|Refractor]] compressed a [[Project:Mirror|copy of the site]] which was then uploaded to the month-old [[clubpenguinwiki:CPWN:Main Page|Club Penguin Wiki Network]] by [[User:Tux|Tux]]. This paved way for the creation of the '''Club Penguin Archives Wiki''': a new wiki dedicated to the archival and preservation of SWF Club Penguin files.

In these early times, [[User:ClubPenguinMaster|ClubPenguinMaster]] was the main editor and administrator on Archives until the Fall of 2012, when new users from the across network began to help out. To adjust to the growing community, the administration was expanded and the new leadership began urging users to upload SWF files of all languages rather than English exclusively.

By the end of 2012, Archives had a small but active community and was appropriately renamed to '''Club Penguin Archives''', with a new main page and logo in time for the wiki's second anniversary. Archives would also see the promotion of their first bureaucrat (ClubPenguinMaster) at [[User:CK|Cp kid]]'s request to Network staff to help Archives become more independent. In May 2015, we continued to expand our library by also including [[wikipedia:JSON|JSON]] files and the [[clubpenguinwiki:Club Penguin (app)|Club Penguin app's]] files.

However, nothing is meant to last forever. On March 29, 2017, the original ''Club Penguin'' closed down and its media database followed two weeks after. The classic game's successor, [[clubpenguinwiki:Club Penguin Island (game)|''Club Penguin Island'']], was discontinued before the end of 2018, marking the indefinite end to the Club Penguin brand. Three years later, [[wikipedia:Adobe Inc.|Adobe]] ended support for [[wikipedia:Adobe Flash|Flash]] and by extension, the SWF file formatâ€” the same file format which Club Penguin had primarily consisted of. Despite these conclusions, the mission of Club Penguin Archives continues to this day.
